## GPUs from Nvidia
- [Nvidia's latest GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-v100/) can do 15 TFlops of SP or 120 TFlops with its new Tensor core architecture which is a FP16 multiply and FP32 accumulate or add to suit ML.
- Nvidia is packing up 8 boards into their[DGX-1](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-server/)for 960 Tensor TFlops.

## GPUs from AMD
The soon to be released [AMD Radeon Instinct MI25](https://instinct.radeon.com/en-us/product/mi/radeon-instinct-mi25/) is promising 12.3 TFlops of SP or 24.6 TFlops of FP16. If your calculations are amenable to Nvidia's Tensors, then AMD can't compete. Nvidia also does twice the bandwidth with 900GB/s versus AMD's 484 GB/s.
